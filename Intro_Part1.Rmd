***This tutorial assumes that R Studio has already been installed and opened.***

## New terms

Package

:   Packages are helpful codes others have already written.

Library

:   Library is a function that tells R to load a package that you have already installed.

Function

:   Functions are codes within packages that do specific things.

### Open Rstudio and create new R script

Click create new R script and then click file, give the file a name to save the file.

### Part1- Importing and loading the data {.tabset}

#### Install and load packages

##### **Start here**

![](C:/Users/hp/AppData/Local/RStudio/tmp/paste-EDFDBD4C.png)

Copy and run the following codes in the boxes in your R script

```{r one, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
x<-c("tidyverse","tidylog", "usethis")
install.packages(x)

```

##### **Explanation of code above**

-   *x (here is just a variable) you can use any name or alphabet letter as a variable.*

-   = or \<- is used to assign or store a value to the variable

-   c( ) makes a vector

-   All text in R are referred to as strings and should be put in single ' ' or double " " quotation marks

<br>

##### **Packages**

Packages are helpful codes others have already written. After you type code, *click Run to run the code.*

<br> ***The packages used in this document**-*

```{r two, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidylog)
library(usethis)
```

|  **tidyverse-** Useful for data cleaning
|  **tidylog-** Useful for analyzing errors when using tidyverse
| 
| ***Usually any word that has a bracket after it is a function.***
|         Functions are codes within packages that do specific things.
|         Eg. install.packages() is a function
|               library() is a function
