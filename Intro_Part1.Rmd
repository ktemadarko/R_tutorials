#### **Required Downloads**

-   Download and install R. Preferred version is 4.0 and higher. [Download R version 4.0.3 for Windows here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ "R verision 4.03 for Windows")[^1]

-   Download and install R studio. Preferred version is 1.4 and higher.[^2]

[^1]: Install and load the installr and updater packages

    `install.packages("installr")` and `library(installr)`

    Then run the function `updateR()` to update your R version.

Refer to the Welcome tab for definitions to new words

Package

:   Packages are helpful codes others have already written.

Library

:   Library is a function that tells R to load a package that you have already installed.

Function[^3]

:   Functions are codes within packages that do specific things.

### **Open Rstudio and create new R script**

Click create new R script and then click file, give the file a name to save the file.

### **Part1- Importing and loading the data** {.tabset}

#### Install and load packages

##### **Start here**

![](C:/Users/hp/AppData/Local/RStudio/tmp/paste-EDFDBD4C.png)

Copy and run the following codes in the boxes in your R script

```{r one, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
x<-c("tidyverse","tidylog", "usethis")
install.packages(x)

```

##### **Explanation of code above**

-   *x (here is just a variable) you can use any name or alphabet letter as a variable.*

-   = or \<- is used to assign or store a value to the variable

-   c( ) makes a vector

-   All text in R are referred to as strings[^4] and should be put in single ' ' or double " " quotation marks.

##### **Required Packages**

Packages are helpful codes others have already written. After you type code, *click Run to run the code.*

##### ***The packages used in this document***

Install these packages using the `install.packages("x")`[^5] function. Remember to replace the "x" with the actual package you want to install.

[^5]: hello

##### Example Packages

To install the package knitr type and run `install.packages("knitr")`.

> Make sure you are connect to the internet. Packages are download from the internet thus installing packages without the internet would not work.
>
> Otherwise 90% of the functions of R and R studio can be done without using the internet.

```{r two, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidylog)
library(usethis)
library(markdown)
library(knitr)
library(DT)
```

##### **tidyverse-**

Useful for data cleaning

##### **tidylog-** 

Useful for analyzing errors when using tidyverse

***Usually any word that has a bracket after it is a function.***

Functions are codes within packages that do specific things.

##### **Example Functions** 

`install.packages()` is a function that downloads and installs packages from R. `library()` is also a function.
